Designed during my time at DSA Incubator, this project uses pivot tables, calculated fields, and interactive dashboards to extract actionable insights on product performance, category trends, customer engagement, and revenue opportunities.
###Objective:  Analyze Amazon product and review data to derive business insights using pivot tables,calculated columns, and data visualizations.
## Project Context
Client Name: RetailTech Insights
Industry: E-commerce Analytics
Role: Junior Data Analyst
Tools Used: Microsoft Excel (Pivot Tables, Charts, Conditional Formatting, Slicers, Cards)

## Dataset Description
‚Ä¢	Total Records: 1,465

o	Category

o	Actual price & Discounted price

o	Discount %

o	Rating

o	Number of Ratings (Rating Count)

## Analysis Tasks
Use pivot tables and calculated columns where necessary to answer the following:
1. What is the average discount percentage by product category?
2. How many products are listed under each category?

9. What is the total potential revenue (actual_price √ó rating_count) by category?
10. What is the number of unique products per price range bucket (e.g., <‚Çπ200, ‚Çπ200‚Äì‚Çπ500, >‚Çπ500)?
11. How does the rating relate to the level of discount?
12. How many products have fewer than 1,000 reviews?
13. Which categories have products with the highest discounts?

### üí° Business Insights (Summary)
1.	High Discount ‚â† High Rating: Many discounted items still received poor ratings. Price cuts alone won‚Äôt ensure customer satisfaction.
2.	Most Reviewed Category: Electronics had the most reviews but also a wide range in satisfaction.
