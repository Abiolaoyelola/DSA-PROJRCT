Analyze Palmora Group HR using Power BI


## Project Context

Client Name: RetailTech Insights

Industry: E-commerce Analytics

Role: Junior Data Analyst

Tools Used: Microsoft Excel (Pivot Tables, Charts, Conditional Formatting, Slicers, Cards)

## Dataset Description
‚Ä¢	Total Records: 1,465

‚Ä¢	Columns: 16

‚Ä¢	Each row represents: A unique product

#### Fields included:
o	Product name

o	Category

o	Actual price & Discounted price

o	Discount %

o	Rating

o	Number of Ratings (Rating Count)

o	Review content (aggregated in some columns)

o	Revenue potential fields (derived)

## Analysis Tasks
Use pivot tables and calculated columns where necessary to answer the following:
1. What is the average discount percentage by product category?
2. How many products are listed under each category?
3. What is the total number of reviews per category?
4. Which products have the highest average ratings?
5. What is the average actual price vs the discounted price by category?
6. Which products have the highest number of reviews?
7. How many products have a discount of 50% or more?
8. What is the distribution of product ratings (e.g., how many products are rated 3.0, 4.0, etc.)?
9. What is the total potential revenue (actual_price √ó rating_count) by category?
10. What is the number of unique products per price range bucket (e.g., <‚Çπ200, ‚Çπ200‚Äì‚Çπ500, >‚Çπ500)?
11. How does the rating relate to the level of discount?
12. How many products have fewer than 1,000 reviews?
13. Which categories have products with the highest discounts?
14. Identify the top 5 products in terms of rating and number of reviews combined.
    
Use Power BI and calculated columns where necessary to answer the following: 
1. What is the gender distribution in the organization? Distil to regions and departments
2. Show insights on ratings based on gender
3. Analyse the company‚Äôs salary structure. Identify if there is a gender pay gap. If there is, identify the department and regions that should be the focus of management
4. A recent regulation was adopted which requires manufacturing companies to pay employees a minimum of $90,000
‚óè Does Palmoria meet this requirement?
‚óè Show the pay distribution of employees grouped by a band of $10,000. For example:
‚óè How many employees fall into a band of $10,000 ‚Äì $20,000, $20,000 ‚Äì $30,000, etc.?
‚óè Also visualize this by regions
5. Calculate the amount to be paid as a bonus to individual employees
6.  Calculate the total amount to be paid to individual employees (salary inclusive of bonus)
7.  Total amount to be paid out per region and company-wide

### üí° Business Insights (Summary)
1.	High Discount ‚â† High Rating: Many discounted items still received poor ratings. Price cuts alone won‚Äôt ensure customer satisfaction.
2.	Most Reviewed Category: Electronics had the most reviews but also a wide range in satisfaction.
3.	Revenue Optimization: Focus marketing efforts on mid-priced, highly rated products in "Home Kitchen" and "Accessories".
4.	Product Opportunity: Products with moderate ratings but high volume reviews may benefit from improved quality or targeted feedback campaigns.
5.	Outlier Products: A few products drive massive engagement. Promoting these further can help with cross-selling.
